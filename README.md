This is a set of tokens and a card holder for the game Äžeconomicus.

They are developped in OpenScad, so you should be able to regenerate everything from the scad files.

At the moment, there are the following interesting files:
- token/token.scad which represents an individual token, and its derived token1_6.stl as well as a bigger token token.stl
- cards/holder.scad which is the holder to hold the playing cards as well as 3 sets of tokens. This way, in the Libre Money part of the game, the tokens can be rotated in order to always have the highest value on the left (or right if you prefer so).

Note that the .ini files are my parameters for slic3r which is currently the main slicer program I'm using for 3D printing. They may not suit you at all!
